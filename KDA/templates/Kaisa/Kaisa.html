                A talent from abroad, Kai'Sa brings a unique style and sound to the industry. 
                She learned to express herself through her craft, blossoming into one of the most talented dancers 
                in the worldâ€”a perfect fit for the misfits of K/DA, where she takes their performances to the next level.
                 <br>
                 <br>

                 legendary discipline and focus to all aspects of her life as a performing artist. She's still not 
                 sure who she'll be when she steps forward to shine as herself, but she's looking forward to the challenge of finding out.
