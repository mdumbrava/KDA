        Setting her old bubblegum pop persona aside, Ahri was determined to shake up her image and reinvent
         herself as an unstoppable force within the music industry. Five years later, she has returned with 
         a sleek new look and a killer sound—and this time she's not alone for Popstars.

         When Ahri returns onto the stage to perform with K/DA their new song, she knows she's surrounded by the best of the best—different 
         girls with different personalities, all at the top of their craft. As their leader and as their friend,
          Ahri is poised to guide these divas to even greater heights and leave their audiences breathless for more.
