                With a stunning voice and a sunny disposition, Seraphine has 
                big dreams about her music and what she can offer the world. She knows that someday, if she just keeps trying, 
                she'll make her beloved cat Bao proud.

                 <br>
                 Seraphine's life is changing faster than she ever expected, and she's trying to hold on 
                 to her unique voice, keep up with Kai'Sa's intimidatingly sharp choreography, and still somehow manage to get enough sleep.

                 <br>
                 After her whirlwind rise to stardom, Seraphine is on top of the world, and the charts, with her feature on 
                 K/DA's new EP. Her music and her message are resonating with her fans, and she's excited to show them 
                 what's to come on her journey of self-discovery through music.

                Seraphine was only a collaborator on 'More' and does not have her own song on the EP, but she has her own single 'Made me this Way'
